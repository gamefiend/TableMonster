Table Monster
=============

Imagine you wanted to buid a table full of different fictional people, with varying distinctive features and traits. You might want to leverage other people to do that, but good luck coordinating all those people!

What if you could do harness that creativity via hashtags on twitter?  That's the basic concept that I am working with. On the website right now is the first deom, but the concept will expand rapidly.
